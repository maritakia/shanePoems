beauty incarnate is what i see you to be
i am the lock u are the key
of fairness divine and kiindness sublime
always and perfect even through time
sway i do to ur every whim
and by the sweetness of that which you hymm
feelings uncertain coarse through me 
torrenting and swinling never to cease be
but as i see u all ceases to be
and i can truly start to be me 
ur eyes do piece my very soul 
of whch my passion u do coal
entranced i a at such a sight
all my resistance fails a ur might
of love i dont know and pain and lonelines i do
these feelings are bear might not be true
but unsure as i am i feel a spark
on my you have left your mark
