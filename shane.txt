pained and hurt as obvious as day
her pain and sorrow cover her wrist 
alas though herpain still stayed 
not to be so easily washed away

my thought to mend her was a lie 
for i just wanted to see her smile
as broken as she was beuty there dwell
beneath all he horror she had bore

what i wanted was for her to see
the beauty that i had known to be
nice yet cruel funnny and mean
a better friend there was not to be
